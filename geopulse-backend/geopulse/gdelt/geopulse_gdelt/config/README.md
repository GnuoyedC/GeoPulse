## CAMEO codes
---
A CAMEO (Conflict and Mediation Event Observations) code is a classification for events found within the GDELT
data set. As such, GeoPulse places a focus on events that closely align with geopolitcal escalation (i.e.
riots, mass armed assaults, terrorism, increased military activity, and so on). These are numerical.

### CAMEO Code 14: Engage in Unconventional Mass Violence
---
Code **14** and its sub-codes refer to acts of unconventional mass violence. This category
typically includes non-military, irregular, or asymmetrical acts of violence often associated
with terrorism, guerrilla warfare, and other forms of non-state violence.

isolated incidents or varied types of violence.

### CAMEO Code 18: Use Unconventional Mass Violence

unconventional mass violence, particularly in contexts involving more deliberate and systematic use of such violence,
often by non-state actors.
Contextually, describes events where there is a deliberate and systematic use of unconventional mass violence, possibly indicating
a higher level of organization or intent.
